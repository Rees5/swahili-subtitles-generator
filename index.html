00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.433
<i>Welcome to Zombieland.</i>

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.400
<i>Back for seconds?
After all this time?</i>

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.551
<i>Well, what can I say,
but thank you.</i>

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.913
<i>You have a lot of choices when it comes to zombie
entertainment, and we appreciate you picking us.</i>

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.676
<i>So you know how Eskimos have
a bunch of words for snow?</i>

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.831
<i>The only reason we've survived
the last several years</i>

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.920
<i>is that we've gotten to know our bloodthirsty
enemies better than we know ourselves.</i>

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.437
<i>In the time since we last saw you,
zombies have evolved,</i>

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.194
<i>so we've given them
different names.</i>

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.958
<i>This lady here is getting chased by the dumbest
Z there is, what we call a Homer.</i>

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.510
<i>In a world without YouTube,
who isn't entertained by a Homer?</i>

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.471
<i>Unfortunately, for every Homer,
there's a Hawking,</i>

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.593
<i>as in Stephen.</i>

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.397
<i>Or maybe his slightly less accomplished sister, Beatrix,
who's still got some brains left to figure shit out.</i>

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.550
Open, open!

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.360
<i>Clever girl.</i>

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.274
<i>Okay. Last one.</i>

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.272
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what was that?</i>

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.396
<i>Okay, all right. Well, this time,
let's play Name That Zombie.</i>

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.470
Hello?

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.160
Hello?

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.880
<i>The Ninja.
Silent, deadly.</i>

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.270
<i>The first thing you hear is
your own scream.</i>

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.070
<i>You can imagine how thrilled we were
to crack the zombie code.</i>

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.680
<i>But life is about more than
just survival.</i>

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.235
<i>Ever since we were evicted from our normal lives,
I'd been searching for a place to put down roots.</i>

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.354
<i>My old pal Tallahassee has this saying,
"Go big or go home."</i>

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.677
<i>It's not his signature phrase,
but it did give me an idea.</i>

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.114
<i>Why not go big...</i>

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.270
<i>and go home?</i>

Hail to the motherfucking chief.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.069
<i>There are worse places
to hang your hat.</i>

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.160
Wait, why does he get to be president?

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.871
I would have made a damn fine president.
Kissed a few hands, shook a few babies.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.879
- You would have brought a real dignity to the office.
- Thank you.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:28.080
You don't have what it takes. I'll be president.
And I nominate Little Rock as my VP.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.631
So that means I get to be president
if you get killed by zombies.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.839
That wasn't what I was thinking
when I offered the position, but yes.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.274
<i>I have this rule:
Enjoy the little things.</i>

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.791
<i>Which is what we spent a lot of time doing
in those early days at the White House.</i>

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.840
<i>And it was a really special time,
making a house our home.</i>

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.717
♪ Happy birthday to ♪

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:56.111
Shooting up, not to.
All right. Nice!

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.276
<i>Wichita and I fell into
our own version of domestic bliss.</i>

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.432
<i>Well, not quite bliss,
but domesticity to be sure.</i>

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.150
- Did Abe's blindfold fall off again?
- No, it did not fall off. I took it off.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.391
It's so creepy.
He just stares at us all night.

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.632
That stare emancipated the slaves, okay?
And it ended the Civil War.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.791
We should be grateful
he's gawking at us.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.475
Remember what happened
the last time you took the blindfold off?

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.399
- You made me sleep on the Lincoln couch?
- Mm-hm.

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.680
- Is that better?
- Much better.

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.114
Good.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.920
<i>- I love you so much, baby.</i>
- Sorry.

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.590
You are so gorgeous.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.717
We really need to find you someone.

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:47.477
That's where you're wrong.
Any romance left in me belongs to the Beast here.

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:50.951
Okay. Well, then we need
to find someone for me.

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:57.072
Shouldn't be a problem,
long as you're open to dating zombies.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.437
So you're saying what?
I'm never gonna find a boyfriend,

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.477
or get married, have a family?

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.156
We're your family,
so one out of three ain't bad.

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.319
<i>Little Rock had a strong desire
to leave the nest.</i>

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.519
<i>And let's just say Tallahassee wasn't
the most understanding father figure.</i>

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:15.636
Little Rock!

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.315
<i>But for better or worse,
we were a family.</i>

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:22.235
<i>And for the first time since the virus,
we were living somewhere truly safe,</i>

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.677
<i>making every day feel like...
Well, like Christmas morning.</i>

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.754
Hello? Ho-ho-ho!

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:32.240
Merry Christmas!

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.959
- Hey, Tal.
- Santa.

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.794
What would you like for Christmas,
little girl? A pony?

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.634
I'd like you to stop calling me
"little girl."

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.872
Well, technically, you are little
and you're a girl.

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:47.670
Well, I am not a little girl,
but do you know what I would like?

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.911
I don't give a fuck what you'd like.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.994
<i>Not to sound too sentimental,</i>

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:57.155
<i>but those days at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue
may have been the best days of my life,</i>

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.833
<i>and that's counting pre-Z.</i>

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:01.760
Wait a second.

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:04.120
Oh, my God. No.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:07.680
A first-edition Tolkien,
and you wrote in it.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.638
There's my name right there,
marring this perfectly preserved paper.

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:15.470
Thank you. And yours too.
You didn't stop. Thank you so much.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.557
It's a bit touching.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:22.475
Hey, I couldn't find any wrapping paper,
but don't worry about it.

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.871
Just tear it open. It doesn't matter.
It's only Taft.

00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:27.360
He was our fattest president,

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.320
so there's a lot left over
if you need some wrapping paper.

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.790
Columbus, I didn't get anything
from you.

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.800
Just what I wanted. Another gun.

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:41.920
Oh, hey, well, not just any gun.
A Colt 45.

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:45.750
And not just any Colt 45.
The King's.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:49.914
- England? Denmark? Lichtenstein?
- There's only one king.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.119
Elvis Aaron fucking Presley,
the greatest who ever lived.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.713
The king of kings.

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.872
He gave this gun to Nixon
when he visited the White House,

00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:03.840
and I give it to you,
locked and loaded.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:07.277
Yeah, he used to shoot
that Colt in his backyard.

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.677
King's palace, Memphis, Tennessee.
I tell you about Graceland?

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:13.434
- Only a hundred times.
- We're gonna go there together someday.

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:15.671
Actually, I'm gonna go
shoot this right now.

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.878
I think I saw some Zs down
by the reflecting pool.

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.633
- Well, I'll go with.
- I'll go by myself.

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.430
- It's Christmas.
- It's not fucking Christmas. It's November 17th.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:29.951
<i>Little Rock was on the hunt, all right,
for people her own age.</i>

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:34.432
<i>And the thing is, they were out there.
We just made it a point to keep our distance.</i>

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:37.274
<i>Which would kind of suck
if you were the one stuck in the nest.</i>

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.559
God, this is really terrifying,

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:44.279
but totally unrealistic.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.480
Hey, she'll be fine.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.515
Wish she didn't remind me
so much of me.

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.831
Hey, come on.
What's wrong with you?

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:56.560
Nothing.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.630
All right. I wasn't gonna do this now.

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:08.237
Okay. Look, you always say that,
like, I play it too safe,

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.915
and I know we've been in, like,
a bit of a rut lately.

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:15.998
So I thought, what better way
to spice things up than to...

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:22.199
Get married?

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:26.160
- Yeah, well, I was gonna say, "Get married!" Yay.
- Is that the Hope diamond?

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:30.154
I certainly hope it is. I want you to be Miss Ohio.
Or I guess Mrs. Ohio.

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.550
This is so unfair.
You know how I feel about this.

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.154
- What?
- We've talked about this.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:39.360
In my limited, but absurdly painful experience,
married people only do one thing.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:42.239
- What, fight? We already do that.
- Get divorced.

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:45.358
I don't see us going that route.
I mean, where would we find the lawyers?

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:51.190
- I don't know what to say.
- Well, don't say anything. Yet.

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:54.557
Okay? This was my fault.
I put you on the spot.

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:58.111
Just think about it,
and let me know whenever you're ready.

00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:01.318
Everything will work out
exactly as it's supposed to.

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:21.718
Hey, Buttercup. What's wrong?
Get a little too much eggnog last night?

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:24.315
- Bad news.
- Bad news?

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.757
Well, you know what cancels out bad news?
Good news.

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:31.390
- Today is the day that Wichita says...
- Adios.

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:32.640
Hm?

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:39.276
"Dear C and T,
we feel like total shit about leaving.

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:42.556
Sorry, not good at notes.
W and LR."

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:47.920
Well, yeah. "Not good at notes" is
a pretty huge understatement.

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:51.916
You know he's gonna
take this Beast thing pretty hard.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.118
Well, he should learn
to not get so attached.

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:59.837
Never get attached. Remember?
That was the problem with Columbus, he got too attached.

00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:05.240
- Well, with Tallahassee, it's like he thinks he's my dad.
- Sure, but you are so lucky you don't have a boyfriend.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:10.076
Have you seen him use Q-tips?
His bedtime routine took an hour.

00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:11.958
- Stop.
- What? God, sorry.

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.157
- No, stop! Stop!
- Oh!

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:21.670
Namaste.

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:25.520
Hi.

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:31.318
<i>Wichita leaving hit me
like a shotgun blast.</i>

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:34.040
<i>So after weeks of feeling sorry
for myself,</i>

00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:37.079
<i>I thought a little retail therapy might help
get her off my mind.</i>

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:40.597
It's not like I immediately wanted to start,
like, wedding planning or anything.

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:41.796
I'm not crazy.

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:44.349
And who wants to get married in the winter?
Spring, sure.

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:49.839
- Although my hair and the humidity...
- Oh, my God! Man, I cannot listen to this shit anymore.

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:53.072
- My God, it's been over a month.
- Yeah, I'm bereft.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:56.153
Okay, I'm giving you one more day
to mope around,

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:59.074
and then you gotta snap the fuck out of it.

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:03.074
This whole "finding a home" idea of yours
has made us soft.

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.311
And by us, I mean you.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:09.434
It's high time that we nut up and hit
the road again. And by we, I mean me.

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:12.991
That's where I belong.
On my own. Lone wolf.

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:14.912
You're welcome to tag along.

00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:18.397
- Yeah, but when they come back, we won't be here.
- They are never coming back.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:26.040
- I got it.
- No, no, no.

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:27.120
Okay.

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:36.197
Yeah, it was good.
You shot your alcohol with your gun.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:50.240
Not bad, huh?

00:13:50.241 --> 00:13:53.791
No. Not bad,
but definitely no ZKOTY.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:57.910
<i>ZKOTY,
that is "Zombie Kill of the Year."</i>

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.469
<i>Like a junkie in search
of a higher high,</i>

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:03.439
<i>Tallahassee is no longer happy
with Zombie Kill of the Week.</i>

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:07.560
<i>Which, if you're keeping score,
just went to Dave Sanderman of Riverside, Iowa.</i>

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:09.791
<i>You may wanna set down
the Milk Duds for this one.</i>

00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:11.155
You dead, zombie!

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.232
Whoo-whee, pig!

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.236
<i>Congratulations, Dave.</i>

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:23.312
Listen, I never told you this before.
In fact, I never told anybody.

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:29.918
But I have Native American blood
coursing through my veins.

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:34.357
- Like, right now?
- Yeah. Right now.

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:40.037
Blackfoot Indian to be exact.
The freest men in history.

00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:45.878
Mid-1800s, roamed the plains,
no houses, no laws, no possessions,

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:49.749
no chiefs to report to,
no wives to listen to.

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:51.035
They listened...

00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:54.875
to the call of the buffalo.

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.758
And they hunted those buffalo

00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:02.279
by herding them off the cliff
to their deaths.

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:06.878
The great buffalo jump.

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:08.440
Oh.

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:12.515
I don't know why I never told anyone
about my Blackfoot blood.

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:15.235
I guess it's a sacred little secret.

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:19.792
Honestly, you're the first paleface
I have genuinely trusted

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:24.432
because you've always been there for me.
You care and you really listen.

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:26.354
<i>Unless you're in a 4D theatre,</i>

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:29.990
<i>there is no way I can communicate
how bad Z-land smells,</i>

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.436
<i>which is why I like candles so much.</i>

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:36.116
<i>Today, maybe a frosty gingerbread
or a Bahama breeze.</i>

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.200
Mmm.

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:39.796
- Whoa!
- Ah!

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:43.351
Oh, my God! Please forgive me.
It's fake fur!

00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:45.671
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
I thought you were a...

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.877
- You thought I was a zombie?
- Yeah.

00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:52.751
Oh, my God, no. I don't even eat meat.
I'm a vegetarian. Vegan, actually.

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:56.516
- Sorry. Hi, I'm Columbus.
- Madison.

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:58.996
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you. Oh.

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:01.675
All right. We're hugging. So soon.
Nice to meet you.

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:04.036
It's nice to touch a human.

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:06.760
- Don't mind me.
- Oh, hello. If I can have my body?

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:10.151
Hi, sorry. This is Tallahassee.
This is Madison. Madison, Tallahassee.

00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:11.839
Is this your dad?

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:16.870
For shit's sake, slightly older,
better-looking friend.

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:18.599
- Cute.
- You live here?

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:23.038
No, Paul Blart. I live in the freezer
in Pinkberry.

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:26.591
It keeps the zombies out,
though it is awfully chilly.

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.876
Do you ever consider turning it off?

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:34.176
Couldn't find the switch, like, anywhere.
Just hoping the electricity would run out.

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:37.193
I know, it's amazing.
As long as it rains, the dams give us power.

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:38.953
Apparently not brain power.

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:47.077
I feel like you're being super judgy.
Like, I'm getting a real anti-me vibe off of you.

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:49.038
- Are you?
- Oh, my God. There it was again.

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:51.191
- Yeah, I saw it.
- And that's hurtful, okay?

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.437
I'm, like,
really good at surviving.

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:58.231
I carry a can of mace with me everywhere I go.
And I can run really, really fast.

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:01.040
Probably because I used to do
a lot of hot yoga and SoulCycle.

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:04.158
Cardio! Sorry,
I do a lot of cardio too.

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:10.197
It's actually my number one rule, which is so dorky.
But I have rules for surviving Zombieland.

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:11.280
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:12.320
So do I!

00:17:12.321 --> 00:17:14.073
You have rules
for surviving Zombieland?

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.675
Actually, mine is just mostly stay
in the freezer.

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:17.955
- Oh.
- Ha, ha.

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:22.030
You know, we actually set up camp, like,
down the road, like, at the White House.

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.310
Ah-ah.

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:26.536
- The White House? Oh, my God.
- Would you wanna come and, like, hang out?

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:28.517
- I would love that.
- Cool.

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:30.796
Okay.
How many rules do you have?

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:33.349
- You wanna know about my rules?
- I wanna hear all of them.

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:36.672
- Well, number two is double tap.
- Double tap.

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.594
- Double tap, yes.
- Double tap you.

00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:40.680
You got me.

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.313
I'm murdered.

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:46.474
<i>Okay, yeah, I know what you're thinking.
She's absolutely not my type.</i>

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:48.313
<i>But after Wichita
broke my heart,</i>

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:53.231
<i>I was just excited to talk to somebody who smelled
like a candle, and not whisky and gunpowder.</i>

00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:57.434
So Wichita and Little Rock left. It leaves
just us guys again. You know, bachelors.

00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:00.035
This guy. You know, making a mess.

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:03.955
Which actually brings me
to rule number 53, Wet-Naps.

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:06.319
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:11.396
- I can't believe that you keep all this stuff in your head.
- Thank you.

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:13.039
- It's amazing.
- Thank you.

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:15.430
- You know, you're really lucky.
- What?

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:19.434
That you found someone so smart
to take care of you.

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:22.877
Most people your age,
they get left all by themselves,

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:25.031
and that can be so sad.

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:28.477
Yeah. I am so lucky.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.516
- Hey, can we have a little summit in the Oval Office?
- Yeah.

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:39.079
You guys, I can't believe we're
in the White House. This is soy random.

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:40.696
<i>You got to broom this girl.</i>

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.074
You know why she's still alive?

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:45.312
Because zombies eat brains,
and she ain't got any!

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:48.996
All right? It doesn't matter
because I'm hitting the road come sunup.

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:50.594
- Columbus?
- Yes?

00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:52.399
Could you maybe give me a tour?

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:55.837
Whoa, this is the Oval Office.

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:57.639
Why do they call it that?

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:01.796
- You ready?
- You ready?

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.234
- I'm ready too.
- I'm ready.

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:04.356
- Great.
- Too.

00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:08.077
- Let's go.
- He's kind of funny.

00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:11.238
- Yeah, he's great. Try not to speak to him.
- Okay.

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:14.154
The main attraction. Ta-da.

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:17.478
The Lincoln bedroom. And believe it or not,
Lincoln never even slept here.

00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:21.076
- I didn't actually want a tour, silly.
- What?

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:22.355
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:24.320
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:26.835
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:29.640
- Don't you think that I'm pretty?
- Yes, you're very pretty.

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:32.519
You're like
"the girl in Apartment 406" pretty.

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:34.751
I just...
I feel kind of guilty.

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.559
Because of Jesus?

00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:39.120
I know ways around that.

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:47.799
- No, no. I... Please. I can't.
- Okay, look, I've been alone in a freezer for years.

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:51.994
So either we're doing this right now,
or I am biting the bullet, and I am doing the old guy.

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:54.760
Okay.

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:59.476
- God! You're so hot! Oh my God!
- It's the humidity.

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:00.596
Oh, yeah!

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:06.510
Holy...

00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:10.149
Nutting up,
definitely not shutting up.

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:12.240
Yeah!

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:29.715
Shit.

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:32.235
Sorry,
it's Washington's old flintlock.

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:34.960
It's a gift to Dwight D. Eisenhower
from the emperor of Japan.

00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:36.190
Oh, touché.

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:39.711
- I heard a strange noise.
- Yeah, I've been hearing some strange noises too.

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:41.991
Oh, yeah.
That was us having sex.

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:43.196
Rule number one.

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:47.075
Yeah,
maybe rule number 32 for her.

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:48.800
What? Hey.

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:51.833
Okay. Ready?

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:55.117
- Go!
- Okay, let's go. Come on.

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:56.998
Oh, fuck.

00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:58.080
Shit.

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:01.679
Honey, I'm home.

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:04.719
Oh, my God, you're back. I mean,
you're back or whatever. That's cool.

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:06.712
I'm not staying.
I just came to get weapons.

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:09.440
- At 1:00 in the morning?
- Yeah, after a month missing.

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:11.909
Little Rock's gone.

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:28.831
It was great. It felt so good
to be on the move again.

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:32.994
Yeah, we've been having, like,
a really good time here too, right? Together.

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:36.630
We picked up someone new.
Just a boy.

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:40.191
He's a couple years older than Little Rock,
and he's from Berkeley.

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:42.351

- Mm-hm.

She's dating a musician!

Hey, come on, dude. Don't you think you're,
like, overreacting maybe, like, a little bit?

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:09.676
Yeah. Yeah. No, I could be overreacting.
I'm sorry. You're right.

- Thank you very much. Thank you.
- Yeah.

00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:06.597
Hey, have you ever heard
of this place, Graceland?

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:10.798
Elvis was a fraud.
He ripped off the black man.

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:15.439
Oh. I don't know.
I've just always wanted to go there.

00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:17.910
Yeah, me too.
Yeah.

- Yeah. Yeah, it would be.

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:27.393
I was adamant it was a dumb idea,
so I did what I never do with her.

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:30.638
I told her no. And you can
probably guess what happened next.

Huh?

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:52.280
I'm so worried,
you guys.

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:55.717
They're travelling all that way,

Yeah, with no intention of ever swinging
it at anything. You know, because he's a hippie.

- She's supposed be killing the dead, not following them.
- Oh, God.

00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:07.431
- There's something going on out there.
- What?

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:12.470
Berkeley told us about this new kind
of zombie that's stronger, and faster,

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:15.200
and deadlier and better adapted
to the hunt.

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:20.797
What? I'm sorry, but that sounds totally made up.
I mean, if you want us to come with you, just, like, ask us.

00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:24.880
- Honestly, I just came back for guns and ammunition.
- Sure. Come on. Stop begging. We'll do it.

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:26.872
- You know, this is all your fault.
- Me?

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.350
- If you hadn't pushed her away...
- Well, not exactly.

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:32.558
No, I didn't just run from him.
She ran from you too.

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:35.160
What?

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:41.078
You... You mean well,
but you're kind of overbearing.

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:46.040
- Oh, right. I'm overbearing?
- She's not a kid anymore.

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:49.591
Yeah, she's not a kid, but I don't know,
it sounds like she needs us.

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:51.956
Whatever.
We're gonna go get her.

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:54.155
We ride at dawn.

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:57.720
Once she's safe,
I'm going my own way.

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:03.871
So no goodbye, just like...

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:05.758
- Yeah, I'm terrible at notes.
- A lame note.

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:08.560
Yeah, I know.
You mentioned that in the note.

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:11.440
I...

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:16.792
I might have overreacted
a little bit.

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:19.270
I mean, the proposal kind
of spooked me.

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:22.352
You know what I'm trying to say.

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:25.798
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:27.752
You know how hard it is
for me to say that

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:31.914
because I hate women who are always apologising
for things they have no reason to apologise for.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:37.678
But in this particular instance,
I actually am really sorry.

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:41.672
Well, thank you.
That actually does mean a lot.

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:44.951
I don't know.
Maybe this could be like a...

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:46.713
Like a turning point for us.

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:49.552
Yeah, maybe.

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:51.950
Columbus, you coming back to bed?

00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:58.920
Wow.

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:00.909
Oh, boy.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.832
I mean, wow!

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:09.876
Glad we had this little talk.
Real turning point.

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:12.720
Hi.

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:18.319
- Is that your sister?
- Oh, fuck.

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:25.555
- You definitely don't need any help. Cool.
- No, I've got it.

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:26.994
The Beast is back.

00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:30.118
I cannot wait
to get my hands behind the...

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:33.152
What the fuck?

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:37.319
No, no, no.

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:41.838
No way is that GD minivan
even sniffing at Graceland,

00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:48.110
home to perhaps America's finest automobile,
Elvis' 1955 Fleetwood Series 60.

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:54.997
No. You know, it takes a real man
to drive a pink Cadillac.

00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:56.753
Might make that a rule of my own.

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:00.471
On second thought, fuck that,
rules are for pussies.

00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:03.638
- Nothing personal.
- How could it not be personal? That's my whole thing.

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:06.952
- Yeah, you're right. It was personal.
- Yeah. Come on. It's gonna be okay.

00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:09.874
<i>Even Tallahassee knows
beggars can't be choosers.</i>

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:13.874
<i>Vehicles with working batteries
and parts are way scarcer nowadays,</i>

00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:16.395
<i>thanks to years of neglect
and decline.</i>

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:17.550
Breakaway mirror.

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:19.393
<i>We can't be so picky anymore.</i>

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:21.597
- Clear.
- What? Oh, okay.

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:22.796
Boo-ya!

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:23.880
Okay.

00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:29.755
This never happened.

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:32.560
- I'll get the door.
- I got it. I'm gonna lay in the back.

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:36.158
- Oh, catch.
- Oh!

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:38.914
Shoot. Ha, ha. I got it!

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.391
What in the butt?

00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:44.233
- Ah, shit.
- What?

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:45.470
- Hi!
- Hi.

00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:50.480
Are we dropping her off
at a no-kill animal shelter or something?

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:53.837
Come on, she's a human being.
We're not gonna, like, leave her here alone.

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:56.992
- Yeah, we can't just leave Columbus' girlfriend.
- Okay.

00:27:58.160 --> 00:27:59.389
A minivan. Nice.

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:02.075
I won't feel guilty.
You left me in the harshest way possible.

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:04.351
- You recovered pretty quickly.
- Well, thank you.

00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:05.510
Can you help me?

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:07.000
- I got it.
- Okay.

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:09.430
- It's just, like, heavy. Thank you.
- No problem.

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:12.797
- Go ahead, get in.
- Okay. You are so nice.

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:24.758
Makkapitew, Askuwheteau,
Sunukkuhkau...

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:26.274
Is he having a seizure?

00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:31.515
I'm trying out Blackfoot names, so full shushy
or you go back in your mall fridge.

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:32.920
- Okay.
- Oh.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.834
I didn't tell you.
We met at the mall.

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:39.072
Yeah.
I was living there.

00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:40.992
Like <i>Dawn of the Dead.</i>

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:44.471
Last I checked,
it's the post-acropolis.

00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:49.874
- It was so sad when the acropolis struck.
- Yeah, I know.

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:54.432
Hey, Madison, can you remind me, when we first met,
did you point a gun at me and steal my car?

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:59.595
No. When we first met,
I told you you were really smart.

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:03.117
- Oh, yeah.
- And then I slept with you.

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.793
That's right. You did.

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:10.034
Road trip! Here we go!

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:12.316
This is gonna be a long drive.

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:24.274
I love the smell of gunpowder
in the morning.

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:26.920
I'm more of a patchouli oil guy myself.

00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:32.114
You don't...
You don't have weed, do you?

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:35.432
I've always wanted to smoke
way too much weed.

00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:39.275
Do I look like the type of person
that would have weed on me?

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:43.036
- Oh, no. I w... That... I'm sorry, that was...
- Boom, yeah.

00:29:44.720 --> 00:29:46.996
- Of course I do. Oh, I love weed.
- You got me there.

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:49.754
- Look. I mean, look at me.
- Yeah.

00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:54.956
I just wanted to say it's really nice
to have another woman around.

00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:57.670
Yeah.

00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:00.832
Like,
to talk about relationships.

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:03.196
- Recipes.
- Rings.

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:06.396
Oh, my God.

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:08.153
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, shit.

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:10.880
I know.

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:14.192
I found it in the bedside drawer.
I think it belonged to the first lady or...

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:19.309
You know what? I think you're right.
It did belong to the first lady.

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:23.519
Well, I think it was given to the first lady,
but she heartlessly rejected it.

00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:26.832
What kind of idiot would turn down
a ring like this?

00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:30.992
Maybe an idiot who didn't
wanna be weighed down.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.834
- Anchored. Chained to something immobile.
- Hm.

00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:41.717
- Oh, shit. Are you okay?
- Oh, shoot!

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:43.393
Forgot the seatbelt rule.

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:45.711
So she knows the rules?

00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:47.519
I mean,
I told her just a few of them.

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:50.434
- Seventy-three. Are there more?
- Nope, that's it.

00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:54.956
- I gotta check this out.
- You guys have spent a lot of time together, huh?

00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:56.560
That's sweet.

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:59.075
You're cute together.
I like it.

00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:00.835
Aww.

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:10.594
This looks promising.

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:20.554
He's so flexible.

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:22.871
That's what's so great about him.
He's very bendy.

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:26.158
- Ohio, whenever you're done with that...
- What? Yeah.

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:30.280
Ah!

00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:33.474
What? No.
No, no, no. No way. Nonstarter.

00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:35.517
You know how I feel
about clowns.

00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:37.398
- No, not that.
- What?

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:39.358
- That.
- Oh.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.000
Looks good.

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:46.679
- Can I see?
- Hm?

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:48.029
Can I see?

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:50.157
Yeah. Here you go.

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:51.240
Yeah.

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:57.318
The old man is so tiny.

00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:59.596
- Can you see that?
- Ha, ha, ha.

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:01.837
What's-his-name, you're so tiny.

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:04.515
Now you're not. Now you are.

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:06.592
Now you're not. Now you are.
Now you're not.

00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:08.637
Tiny. Big. Tiny!

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:11.997
- She is adorable.
- She is. I'm lucky.

00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:13.878
Tiny. Big. Tiny.

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:17.416
Look, you're overreacting, okay?

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:18.874
Madison's not, like, a real thing.

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:21.714
It was just circumstance.
It was, like, a lack of options.

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:23.757
- You could say the same thing about us.
- What?

00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:27.754
- Circumstance, lack of options.
- Really? You really think that?

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:31.396
Whereas you two seem like soul mates.
Destined to share deep, intellectual thoughts.

00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:35.156
Maybe you're right, maybe we are soul mates,
okay? Because she's nice, all right?

00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:38.551
And I'm nice. And you're not.
You're mean.

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:41.030
- Whatever. I'm not mean.
- Yeah, you're kind of mean.

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:42.600
Well, my sister is missing.

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:45.479
She could be dead, and you're screwing
some Forever 21-year-old.

00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:48.712
- So if I wanna be mean, I'll be mean.
- I don't have the right shoes for this.

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:51.674
- Oh, you could borrow a pair of my strappy sandals.
- Really?

00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:52.760
Mm-hm.

00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:58.110
Kidding. You... She was ki...
You guys are all very sarcastic.

00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:01.272
Yeah, they're not nice people.
Sorry about that. Just try to ignore them.

00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:02.360
Yeah. Yeah.

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:04.750
- Ignore us.
- Please, God, ignore us.

00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:05.956
See? Mean.

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:10.797
All right!

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:12.439
This is what I'm talking about.

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:14.876
We're finally gonna be riding in style.

00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:18.476
You guys, I partied with 3 Doors Down
in one of these. It was so...

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:20.400
Oh, shit.

00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:26.076
What?

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:29.456
- Man, we're getting good at this.
- Columbus.

00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:30.480
Tallahassee.

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:34.476
- The hood is 12 o'clock, trunk is 6. You're our eyes.
- Yes.

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:37.792
Hey, don't worry, you guys.

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:40.873
They are much more afraid of us
than we are of them.

00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:43.634
God, that is not even
remotely true.

00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:45.313
Well, what do I do?

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:47.631
- You know how cheerleaders form a pyramid?
- Yeah.

00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:51.037
- You know how the three on the bottom anchor the pyramid?
- Oh, yeah.

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:54.033
I don't give a shit what you do,
just stay out of my way.

00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:56.430
Okay, 8 o'clock.
Eight o'clock.

00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:59.752
Did you say the front was 12?
Oh, fuck me. Sorry. Two o'clock.

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:02.719
Eleven! Eleven! Seven-thirty!

00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:04.837
Six o'clock. Six!

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:06.036
I'll get 6.

00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:09.160
Shit. One-fifteen.

00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:11.510
One-thirteen, 1:20. I don't know.
It's moving that way.

00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:14.035
- Why is everyone shouting numbers?
- Eleven!

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.000
- Twelve!
- Six!

00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:18.676
Two o'clock!

00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:20.200
Eight.

00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:23.153

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:28.679
One o'clock. Six-thirty.

Okay. I'll get 3.

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:55.840

Actually, you know what,
it's a Homer.

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:08.037
- Abort! Abort 11. Don't waste a bullet.

00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:17.520
Ha-ha-ha! Yay!

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:21.710
- Ah! He's trying to bite me!
- Ninja! Ninja!

00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:23.120
Oh, my God!

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:26.831
You saved me.

00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:28.274
All right. Settle down.

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:35.510

In moments of great dishonour such as this,

00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:55.996
ancient samurai warriors
were required to commit seppuku,

00:38:56.080 --> 00:39:01.075
or ritual suicide by disembowelment.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.434
My mom had this car.

Back on the road. Yay.

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:29.991
I've always wanted
to start a business

00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:34.791
where strangers drive strangers
around in their car for money.

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:38.872
Let's say you were really drunk
and you needed a ride home.

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:42.317
You'd just get online
and hop right in with a stranger.

00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:45.000
And they'd take you
anywhere you wanna go.

00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:47.037
Oh, yeah.
Who then kills you.

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:50.477
- Yeah.
- They'd have gum or, like, lollipops.

00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:52.074
That was what my parents taught me.

00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:57.673
They were like, "If a stranger offers you
candy or gum, get in their car." Great idea.

00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:01.197
If they try to murder you, you can have
a point system, so you can rate them.

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:03.749
If they try to murder you, like,
"You get zero points."

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:07.277
- But if they don't try to murder you, "You get five points."
- Okay.

00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:09.670
Madison, I think
it is a very good idea.

00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:15.438
- That's... No, I cannot see that going wrong.
- All I'm saying is the taxi industry was very flawed.

00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:20.636
- Uh.
- Are you okay?

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:24.316
- I think I'm, like, hot. I'm hot.
- Yeah?

00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:28.440
Mm-hm. I'm so used to being in the freezer
all the time. Get this off.

00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:30.751
Oh, yeah, yeah. Sure.
Yeah, that makes sense.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.469
I feel funny.
My tongue...

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:41.512

My tongue...

00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:44.593
- Hey, boss? You're gonna wanna pull over.
- Yeah?

00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:45.680
- No.
- Pull over.

00:40:45.681 --> 00:40:47.911
- No, we're making good progress here.
- Pull over!

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:51.072
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

00:40:57.440 --> 00:40:58.440
- Oh.
- Oh.

00:40:58.560 --> 00:40:59.560
Chunkage.

00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:01.398
I don't know,
maybe she'll pull through.

00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:04.592
What do you mean? You are the one
who always says "don't take chances."

00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:09.435
So who wants
to do the honours?

00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:16.557
I mean, personally, I wouldn't mind,
but I don't want you guys calling me selfish.

00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:21.118
Hey, come on. She is a living, thinking being.
Okay? She's a living being.

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:25.911
Look, I know you guys are
in love or whatever,

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.310
but in two minutes,
she's gonna become a:

00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:34.553
A zombie, not a velociraptor.
And it's the right thing to do.

00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:40.318
If you love something, you shoot it in the face
so it doesn't become a flesh-eating monster.

00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:44.275
- I know.
- She's making a good point.

00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:49.799
Maybe it's time for you
to be the Brave Little Toaster.

00:42:17.520 --> 00:42:19.751
- Madison, please. Please, please.
- Don't hurt me!

00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:21.274
- No, no, no!
- Wait. Listen to me!

00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:22.480
- Please. Wait.
- No, no, no!

00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:24.671
- Madison, just wait.
- I'm a monster.

00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:26.479
- I'm a monster.
- Please, please, please.

00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:29.075
Listen. I realise that we don't
know each other that well.

00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:33.791
I mean, well, we do in the biblical sense, yes.
But I think you're a really great person.

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:37.836
Well, not now.

00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:41.390
I'm sorry.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:56.320
Thanks.

00:42:57.320 --> 00:42:58.959
Can we just...

00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:02.750
- I'm so sorry.
- All right. Just... Come on, come on, let's go.

00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:18.354
I'm not gonna lie and say
that I'm broken up about it, but...

00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:22.598
I am sorry.

00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:24.672
- She didn't deserve that.
- Thanks, man.

00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:25.796
- Thanks.
- He's right.

00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:29.389
That's a terrible way to go,
even for...

00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:33.880
- Oh, come on. It's Madison. You know that.
- Madison. Madison.

00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:37.431
Yes, you know that, okay? Her name is Madison.
Or her name was Madison.

00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:39.477
You know, and she was
a real person, okay?

00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:43.349
She had, you know, complex feelings
and emotions and interests.

00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:48.555
You know, she liked dolphins and rainbows,
you know? And double rainbows.

00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:50.916
I'm agreeing.
It's sad.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:52.992
- Okay.
- That is obviously not what I wanted.

00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:55.720
- What is it that you do want?
- I wanna find my sister.

00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:56.870
Me too.

00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:58.599
- Good.
- Good.

00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:01.036
- Good. Great. Awesome.
- Great, in fact. Great.

00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:02.918
This is gonna be a long drive.

00:44:14.200 --> 00:44:15.200
This is it.

00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:21.235

for waking you up, but we're here.

00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:25.034

00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:27.271

has been leading me to this moment right here,

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:37.199
right now,
3764 Elvis Presley Boulevard.

00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:40.677
I feel like a 1954 teenybopper.

00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:41.910
And here comes...

00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:45.520
No.

00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:50.272
No, no, no!

00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:52.955
Hey, dude, if you need
a moment or...

00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:55.635
Oh, my God.
No Graceland.

00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:57.359
No Beast.

00:44:57.440 --> 00:45:00.160
- No Little Rock.
- No Little Rock?

00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:06.714
Am I not allowed one cock-sucking
duck-fucking little break in this world?

00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:08.837
You're not the only one
that's upset.

00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:12.596
Just... Just drive.
Drive, drive. Drive now!

00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:14.558

00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:27.760
Hm.

00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:39.954
What?

00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:44.114
Hound Dog Hotel.
Oh, what a bunch of bull.

00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:48.879
- Whoa! The Beast!
- Little Rock!

00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:59.400
Damn. Wow,

00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:03.440
for a place that ain't Graceland, it sure
looks a hell of a lot like Graceland.

00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:06.672
- Yeah, it does.
- Here's the idea. We'll split up. I'll go this way.

00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:08.479
No, no, no.
I should talk to her.

00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:11.951
- I'm her sister. I'll talk to her first. You guys stay here.
- Sound.

00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:16.274
Bop, bop, bop!

00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:19.035
- Little respect.
- Why? He's dead probably.

00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:21.631
Oh. Oh, for you.
Okay.

00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:26.237
- This is so degrading.
- It's not for me.

00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:27.356
Yeah, I know.

00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:30.034
Okay.

00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:33.750
- Oh, yeah. That's not... Push it.
- Smells like a wet dog died.

00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:35.672
- I am. Okay.
- Square peg, round hole. Stop.

00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:36.760
Sorry.

00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:43.715

- Hi, my name's Tallahassee.
- Nevada.

00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:05.995
- Which part?
- Nevada's as close as you get.

00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:07.992
Now, what are you doing
in the Hound Dog?

00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:11.118
I got a thing for the King.

00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:14.273
No, no, no,

00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:18.075

- No, no. Just us.

We're all civilised people.
Let's just put the guns down.

- Yeah.

So that car out front, the girl
who was driving it, is she...

00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:35.673
Gone. She and that poser
peace lover of hers...

00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:37.353
- Berkeley.

00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:39.589
...took off a few days ago.

00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:42.832
And trust me, they shouldn't have.
It's not safe out there.

00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:45.719
- Damn it.
- Why didn't they take the Beast?

00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:51.637
- He said it was too "establishment."
- Oh, I will kill that little fart snack myself.

00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:55.993
You're lucky I didn't do the same to you. Seriously.
You know how close I came to Murraying you?

00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:00.396
To what-ing him?

00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:03.238
Murraying him.

00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:06.279
You know, when you shoot someone
because you think they're a zombie.

00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:08.158
Apparently,
that's how Bill Murray died.

00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:12.831
Wow. God, who's Bill Murray?
I never... I don't even know what that is.

00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:17.039
Oh, the actor. That's so sad.
I don't read, like, <i>Variety</i> or anything.

00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:19.715
So sad. Sorry if you knew him.
If you didn't, I'm still sorry.

00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:22.474
It's sad when anybody dies.
Sounds like an urban legend though.

00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:25.200
- It happened.
- I doubt it. It's weird. What?

00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:34.231
I'll say this about Murray, if I ever
find out who did him, I'm gonna do him.

00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:36.835
Me too. I'll be...
You first, but me second.

00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:39.754
Don't listen to this guy.
He's killed more celebrities than cocaine.

00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:43.151
The girl that was here before,
did she say where she was going?

00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:48.076
No, but that idiot Berkeley
wouldn't shut up about it.

00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:51.870
Babylon is a commune, safe haven,
protected on all sides.

00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:55.271
Completely pacifist.
No guns or violence of any kind.

00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:59.036
A lot of young people too, you know.
Generation Z living in peace and harmony.

00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:00.236
Yeah, it sounds cool.

00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:18.839

where he recorded his last two albums.

00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:22.675
<i>From Elvis Presley Boulevard,
Memphis, Tennessee</i> and...

00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:23.760

00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:26.240

00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:33.080
What's yours?

00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:37.393
My mama took me to see Elvis
when I was a kid. Something about him.

00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:40.871
- Attitude, the music...
- The hips, the ass.

00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:45.317
Well, I was 10, but, you know, with Elvis,
there is something for everyone.

00:50:45.400 --> 00:50:49.599
Cut to later, I'm in high school.
And my buddy Frankie Hammond says:

00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:52.872
"Do your Elvis."

00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:56.237
I said, "We're in a library.
It's gonna be loud."

00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:59.916
He convinces me. He starts
tapping his pencil, and I get up.

And up comes the cutest girl
in the school,

00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:31.839
Robin Rogers, who never gave me
the time of day before.

00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:34.151
She plants a kiss on my cheek.

00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:38.439
And for a moment, just one,
I felt like the King.

00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:44.313
I suddenly feel a little jealous
of Robin Rogers.

00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:47.432
Ahem.
You don't say.

00:51:49.640 --> 00:51:51.233
I don't know about you...

00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:54.558
but I feel my temperature rising.

00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:05.920
This is Babylon.

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:08.640
Oh, like those ancient hanging gardens.

00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:11.477
- Huh?
- Of Babylon.

00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:14.712
No, no. It's named
for that cool David Gray song.

00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:16.757
Man, I wish I'd written that one.

00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:20.674
No guns allowed is our one rule.

00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:23.080
- That, and no group sex.
- All right. Hand them over.

00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:27.560
Here you go.

00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:31.156
No guns. No guns.
Just hugs.

00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:32.993
Then welcome.

00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:37.438
Come on, señorita. You're gonna love this place.
It's completely safe and entirely organic.

00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:39.240
- This is so cool.
- All right.

00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:42.000
We're gonna melt your guns over here
and then give you a pendant.

00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:43.816
- They melt it?
- Yeah, they melt it.

00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:45.240
It's a symbolic thing.

00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:48.438
Goodbye, violence.
Hello, peace.

00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:52.514
Once we're done here, we'll take you up
to the rooftop. I hope you like stairs.

00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:53.636
That's good.

00:52:57.400 --> 00:52:59.676
- Thanks.
- Welcome to Babylon.

00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:01.592
Let me show you the way.

00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:02.796
Right on.

00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:08.913
Hey, brother. What's up?

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:10.798
- Hi.
- Yeah.

00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:34.999
Wake up, my little blue suede baby.
It's now or never.

00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:36.080
Hoo!

00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:39.358
My friends say you're
sleeping like a tired pup.

00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:42.590
What the fuck?

00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:45.240
Shit.

00:53:52.040 --> 00:53:54.396
Oh, no, no, no!

00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:56.392
This is not happening!

00:53:56.480 --> 00:53:59.518
This is not fucking happening!

00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:01.671
Hey, motherfucker,
that's my ride!

00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:07.552
Oh, my apologies, tiny Elvis. Just didn't
expect anything to be parked in my driveway.

00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:08.830
Your driveway?

00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:13.080
That's right.
My driveway.

00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:16.756
Well, that's funny. When I parked
in it, no one told me to pull out.

00:54:18.040 --> 00:54:20.430
Well, actually,
it's my driveway.

00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:22.239
Hey, Nevada.

00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:27.196
But see, when I'm in town,
I use it.

00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:30.637
Well, I'm in town now,
and I'm using it.

00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:35.670
Keep talking like this, and I can arrange
so neither of you ever uses my driveway again.

00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:38.912
- I don't think they're talking about the driveway.
- No, I don't think so.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:41.390
- You happy now? Great. Good move.
- Satisfied? Good job.

00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:44.234
- Is it me, or does he kind of remind you of...?
- Yeah, it's weird.

00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:46.994
- I don't like you at all.
- I don't like you at all.

00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:48.355
It's not weird,
it's creepy.

00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:53.271
- It's like an un-funhouse mirror.
- I think you double-parked or more perpendicular-parked.

00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:55.317
- Hope we don't get a ticket.
- Whoa.

00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:57.392
- Calm down. It's okay.
- I'm just ragging you.

00:54:57.520 --> 00:54:59.989
- What is going on here?
- What?

00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:02.072
- What do you mean, "what"?
- What?

00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:04.914
- Does he not remind you of...?
- Hello everyone.

00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:07.120
Of...
Of what?

00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:09.471
- This is Albuquerque. I'm Flagstaff.
- Howdy.

00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:10.755
Hey.
I'm Columbus.

00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:11.840
Oh, great.

00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:16.155
This is Tallahassee, Wichita,
and I guess you know Nevada.

00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:18.471
- Yes, I do.
- Easy, cowboy.

00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:24.158
So sorry about your ex-car. I guess,
as I like to say, expect the unexpected.

00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:26.754
- It's one of my commandments.
- Oh.

00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:29.320
- Commandments?
- Yeah.

00:55:29.321 --> 00:55:32.313
Just sort of guidelines for staying alive.
I've got loads of them.

00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:34.915
- Interesting.
- Yeah, number one is teamwork.

00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:38.750
- Teamwork. That's so great.
- Thanks. I actually spent a long time thinking about it.

00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:42.016
- I have rules, you know, which is, like, less biblical.
- Love rules.

00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:44.236
Without rules,
everything's chaos.

00:55:44.360 --> 00:55:46.750
- Thank you.
- Columbus has quite a few rules.

00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:47.960
- I do.
- Awesome.

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:48.920
Like what?

00:55:48.921 --> 00:55:51.277
- I don't wanna toot my own horn.
- Go on, toot, toot.

00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:53.477
- Let me toot for him.
- Thank you.

00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:56.473
- Number one, cardio.
- That's right.

00:55:56.560 --> 00:55:57.630
Cardio.
Okay.

00:55:57.720 --> 00:55:59.677
- What?
- I don't mean to laugh.

00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:03.754
It's just that cardiovascular fitness
is his number 29,

00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:07.112
meaning he has 28 other commandments
that he finds more important,

00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:09.715
like, say,
what's one of your great ones?

00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:11.154
Number 12.

00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:14.711
The world is your bathroom, meaning you can
just whip it out wherever you want,

00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:15.760
and just have at it.

00:56:15.761 --> 00:56:19.391
Oh, just whip it out wherever you want!
That sounds a little uncouth.

00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:23.673
The "whip it out" part's for guys, obviously.
If you're a woman, you can reveal it.

00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:26.911
- Whichever.
- I have beware of bathrooms.

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:29.117
Yeah, I'm just generally careful
around them.

00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:32.080
- We don't have to compare. It's not a competition.
- Doesn't have to be.

00:56:32.120 --> 00:56:34.271
But number 18 is limber up.

00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:36.192
- But that's...
- That's fine. I have warm up.

00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:40.718
Again, not a competition,
but commandment number 45 for me is,

00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:41.870
well, mind your manners.

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.720
Just because it's the apocalypse
doesn't mean you have to be rude.

00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:47.634
Yeah, keep your hands to yourself, number 42.
Do you have sunscreen?

00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:49.518
- Just shade.
- Shade. Of course.

00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:52.479
It's free. It's everywhere.
Yeah. Number two, double tap.

00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:55.997
- I have number five, confirm your kill.
- Confirm your kill.

00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:58.959
- Avoid perishables. Do you have that?
- Sorry. Ziploc bags.

00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:01.111
- Same thing, different word. Yeah.
- Yeah. Exactly.

00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:03.317
I probably would shy away
from the word "Ziploc"

00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:05.033
because I try
to avoid name brands.

00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:08.113
Okay, great. So, what brought
you guys back so soon?

00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:11.113
We was headed for the Rockies,
but the goddamn Bolts...

00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:12.276
Bolts?

00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:14.680
- Yeah.
- Yeah, the zombies out on the plains.

00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:16.797
They're a lot tougher than
what we're used to.

00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:21.909
I guess because of all the running and hunting.
So we call them Bolts, as in Usain.

00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:25.391
- As in pretty fucking athletic.
- Oh, yeah. No, that makes total sense.

00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:27.995
- We actually call them T-800s.
<i>- Terminator.</i> Yes! I love it.

00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:30.616
- Really?
- Yes. Literally my favourite movie. Well, <i>T2.</i>

00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:33.439
- Yeah, <i>T2</i> is my second favourite movie.
- What's number one?

00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:35.750
It's <i>Fantasia.</i>

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:42.075
Well, anyhow, the Bolts' food sources are running low,
so they're pushing east, which is <i>no bueno.</i>

00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:44.152
You know what else is
<i>no bueno?</i>

00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:46.992
You murdered the Beast.

00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:52.434
Yeah, well, let me call AAA
for you. I'm sure they'll be right over.

00:57:52.520 --> 00:57:54.751
So you have
to play your cards as...

00:57:54.840 --> 00:57:57.878
That onesie was starting
to cut off my circulation.

00:57:57.960 --> 00:57:59.838
To your vagina?

00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:00.880
Your vagina.

00:58:00.881 --> 00:58:05.557
- What'll you have, Florida?
- He strikes me as the lemon drop type.

00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:08.519
You know, something with an umbrella
or something like that.

00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:12.190
- I heard "something with an umbrella." Make it two.
- Three please. Three.

00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:13.600
So that's your sidekick.

00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:15.856
That there's my partner.

00:58:15.880 --> 00:58:21.035
You might look at Flagstaff and think,
"Oh, he's a little slight, diminutive."

00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:24.909
Effeminate even, but he's a real beast
in battle. Yeah.

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:27.469
Come on now. You're being sweet.
You sweet, sweet man.

00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:28.835
- Thank you.
- Well, I love you.

00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:29.840
Love you too.

00:58:29.841 --> 00:58:35.359
Yeah, you know, Tubbs to my Crockett over here.
He may look a little bookish, but he's an animal too.

00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:38.035
He eats zombies for breakfast,
shits them out by lunch.

00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:39.160
Cheers.

00:58:39.161 --> 00:58:41.197
He shits out everything
by lunch.

00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:45.840
What the hell was that?

00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:52.216
They must have
fucking followed you.

00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:54.197
Oh, God, those are T-800s.

00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:56.078
Or at the very least T-700s.

00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:58.834
- There actually was no T-700.
- Yeah, T-800's the first model.

00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:02.436
- This is great, having two of you.
- Okay.

00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:04.477
Time to nut up or shut up.

00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:07.354
That saying's very 2009.

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:12.354
Okay.
We got this.

00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:13.640
Ho!

00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:15.991
You don't send
a boy to do a man's job.

00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:18.356
We brought them here.
We'll take care of it.

00:59:18.440 --> 00:59:20.830
Yeah, you know what?
Have at them.

00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:23.998
- Yeah, you have a safe word in case things go bad?
- Ha. That's good.

00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:27.517
- Come on, Flag, let's show these fuckers how it's done.
- Sure. You got it, boss.

00:59:28.840 --> 00:59:31.275
<i>Hasta la vista,</i> baby.
<i>Terminator 2.</i>

00:59:31.360 --> 00:59:32.510
Remember?

00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:33.600
Whoo! Ready, buddy?

00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:35.114
He's so cool.

00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:38.176
- Whoo! Hell!
- Suck these bullets!

00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:39.560
Come on! Get you some!

00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:42.957
- Anybody else find those two uniquely annoying?
- Get it!

00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:45.191
Uniquely?
No.

00:59:47.080 --> 00:59:48.799
Well,
I don't love their chances.

00:59:48.880 --> 00:59:51.600
And they ignored rule 52,
don't be afraid to ask for help.

00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:53.911
Get fucked in the face,
bitch! Whoo!

00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:55.434
- Flagstaff?
- Yeah, boss?

00:59:55.520 --> 00:59:58.638
You made the all-star team today.
I mean, no kidding.

00:59:58.720 --> 00:59:59.949
Unbelievable job.

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:03.920
And is it me, or are those Bolts
just getting meaner by the day?

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.275
They're full-blown dickheads.

01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:09.195
I got an action shot of you
that's going right into the scrapbook.

01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:10.555
This is gonna be a good one.

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:15.840
You just keep raising the bar, and that's why
we will continue to ride these highways together.

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:18.230
- I'm so proud of you.
- Well, I learned from the best.

01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:19.240
Oh, come on now.

01:00:19.241 --> 01:00:21.597
- Nice work, Querq.
- Thank you. Thank you.

01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:25.680
- This is gonna be a hell of a shot.
- It's so cool he let you wear the hat.

01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:28.200
- Querq?
- Yeah?

01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:30.317
I think you got
a little something here.

01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:34.240
Oh, what that?

01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:39.111
Oh, yeah, that's just...
That's just a tattoo.

01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:47.953
- Sorry, you got a tattoo of a zombie bite?
- No, it's just a tattoo I got one night in Bernalillo.

01:00:50.160 --> 01:00:53.073
All right, everybody.
Just take it easy.

01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:55.072
Everything's fine.

01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:57.880
Nevada, why don't you whip up
some of your signature...

01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:04.111
All right.
That was a little weird, huh?

01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:07.600
- Yeah.
- All right. Just calm down.

01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:09.831
We'll just kind of have a drink, you know.

01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:13.992
So we can just kind of celeb...
Celeb...

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:21.358
Excuse me. It's okay. It's just nerves
from the fight. Just...

01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:26.438
You guys, I think Albuquerque
might be infected.

01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:28.239
Me? I'm infected?

01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:30.589
You got bit twice.

01:01:30.680 --> 01:01:31.600
Flagstaff!

01:01:31.601 --> 01:01:34.639
No, no, no. That's a lie.
Trust me. Okay? Trust me.

01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:38.396
- I don't get bit. I never get bit.
- I know. I don't get bit either. We're slippery.

01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:39.800
- See?
- I know. Are you okay?

01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:41.917
- I'm fine. I'm totally fine. I'm fine.
- You are?

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.151
- I'm fine.
- Okay. Okay, guys, he's fine. He's fine.

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:46.799
No, he's not fine.
No.

01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:50.794
No. Flagstaff, you're starting to look
like a T-800. <i>Terminator 2.</i>

01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:54.275
No. No, no, no!

01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:56.560
No!

01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:00.672
Move! Move!
Get out of the way.

01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:08.360
No! No!

01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:12.833
Flagstaff, you're breaking
like 10 commandments right now!

01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:21.390
This is for what you did
to the Beast!

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:24.520
Sorry!

01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:27.430
- How you doing?
- Bad!

01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:29.034
- How are you?
- Bad!

01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:32.757
Sorry, shoes. Sorry, Elvis.

01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:40.680
Oh, shit.

01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:45.599
- How you doing now?
- Still bad! You wanna switch?

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:47.672
Switch? How would that benefit me?

01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:57.520
Shit!

01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:05.640
Help!

01:03:05.641 --> 01:03:08.679
- Shoot him! Shoot him!
- I don't wanna hit you!

01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:14.470
Shit.

01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:17.240
Gun, gun, gun! Shit!

01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:22.038
Stop shooting!
I got this!

01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:23.600
Great, because I'm reloading!

01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:35.712
Don't swing! Don't swing!
Don't swing! Swing!

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:37.480
Shit.

01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:41.114
No, no, no, not me!
Not me! Oh, fuck!

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:43.317
<i>Hasta la vista,</i> baby.

01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:46.671
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:49.400
Those guys were dicks.

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:53.400
- Great job.
- Thank you.

01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:56.436
- Can I wear the hat?
- Oh, negatory.

01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:57.440
Cool.

01:03:57.441 --> 01:03:59.079
Zombie Kill of the Year?

01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:04.960
<i>Sorry. Not with the performance just
turned in by Matteo Bianchi of Pisa, Italy.</i>

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:08.915
Help! I'm a lost tourist
with two defenceless children.

01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:11.200
Help!

01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:16.431
Fucking sons of bitches!

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.992
<i>Yeah, yeah. That Pisa.</i>

01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:23.912
You won't eat me.

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:26.279
Not today!

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.753
Go fuck yourselves!

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.559
Bravisimmo, <i>Mateo.</i>

01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:45.839
- Ahh. Sunday, Sunday, Sunday!
- Jesus, Big Fat Death is right.

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:48.560
That thing is, like,
a huge rollover risk.

01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:49.640
It is.

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:52.960
Hey, dude, I think you should
ask her to come with us.

01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:57.117
- No, no, no.
- Come on. I think they make a nice match.

01:04:57.200 --> 01:05:01.160
Look, what have I been telling you guys?
I'm trying to shed baggage, not pick it up.

01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:05.752
- Yeah.
- Besides, she wouldn't do that. She's not the type.

01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:10.553
Stay safe,
Sunshine State.

01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:13.590
Excuse me.

01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:20.033
Stay dangerous, Nevada.

01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:32.160
Okay. Hey, no offence,
but my sister is still out there.

01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:34.670
Wanna hit the old road.

01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:38.196
If by some miracle you don't die...

01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:42.520
there's always room
in my driveway.

01:05:45.120 --> 01:05:46.634
I best stay alive.

01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:51.039
Okay, you're back.
Good.

01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:53.157
So do you know how to drive
one of these things?

01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:58.952
I'm gonna just pop that puppy off of there
and then you guys can jump in.

01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:00.040
Nice.

01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:05.354
She's a big old stallion,
but I can tame her.

01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:13.880
Whoo!

01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:18.920
Oh, shit.

01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:25.476
- I think he's got the hang of it.
- Shit!

01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:27.960
- No. No, no.
- No, no, no.

01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:30.839
Goddamn motherfucker!

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:31.920
Got it.

01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:41.350
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:42.715
Fuck!

01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:44.393
Maybe you should leave a note.

01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:47.149
That's your department.

01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:55.477
I...
I just can't do it.

01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:56.880
Yeah.
I'll drive.

01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:05.199
What was that?

01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:07.510
Satisfying.

01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:17.115
Teamwork. Always put the team first.
I can't believe I didn't have that. Stupid.

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:19.510
You know,
if Flagstaff was so great,

01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:25.995
then where was the undeniably gorgeous
but emotionally inaccessible Kansas City?

01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:29.909
I don't know. Maybe she split because
she thought they had a random relationship.

01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:36.435
Or maybe she was just about to come back under
the thinly veiled cover of needing guns and ammo.

01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:39.238
Wait, what are you getting at?

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:43.312
I think you're smart enough
to figure it out...

01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:44.629
Oh, my God.

01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:46.200
You gotta be kidding me.

01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:48.270
You gotta be kidding me.

01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:53.878
- You gotta be kidding me!
- You gotta be fucking kidding me.

01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:55.440
Why the hell is she still alive?

01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:58.274
Oh, my God,
I literally missed you guys.

01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:00.318
- Yay!
- Oh, my God.

01:08:03.840 --> 01:08:05.240
Just...
No, just look ahead.

01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:07.994
Hi, old guy!

01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:09.400
Let's hang out.

01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:13.036
It is so weird to see you.
The last time I saw you, you were like a...

01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:14.793
- You were a zombie.
- I wish.

01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:16.837
Stupid nut allergy.

01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:18.479
- Nut allergy?
- Yeah.

01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:21.029
Yeah, I think it was the trail mix
that Wichita gave me.

01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:23.191
Yeah, who knew there were nuts
in trail mix.

01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:25.192
Not me. I thought it was vegan.

01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:30.679
I kept trying to tell you it was only an allergic reaction,
but you thought I was trying to bite you.

01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:33.594
- Yeah, well...
- Not that you minded last time.

01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:37.238
Thank you
for shooting over my head.

01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:39.391
I was reallyjust trying
to scare you off.

01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:41.278
You're not gonna get rid
of me that easy.

01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:43.033
- Oh, no!
- Ha, ha, ha.

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:48.878
There I was hiding in the woods,
when I thought, "I used to live in a freezer,

01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:50.917
so why not a freezer on wheels?"

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:52.992
Can't argue with that logic.

01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:54.958
I really miss this.

01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:58.390
- Was that sarcasm?
- Was it?

01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:00.520
Mm-hm.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.595
Why wouldn't we just move to an island?

01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:11.469
- That's a really good idea.
- Because then there wouldn't be zombies.

01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:14.632
- Of course.
- We should go to Temptation Island.

01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:18.397
Hey, hey, hey.

01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:19.400
- What?
- Hey, hey.

01:09:19.401 --> 01:09:21.199
- Hey, hey. Hey, hey.
- Hey, hey.

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:23.919
Just...
Just eyes on the road.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.640
Do you want me to change
the CD or anything?

01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:28.279
Is this a CD playing?

01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:30.875
- Yeah. It's Port... It's Portishead.
- What is this?

01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:34.191
- This is Portishead?
- Yeah. You know what's funny?

01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:39.190
I used to think it was called "Portashed" until I went
to one of the concerts, and she explained.

01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:40.879
Yeah, I would think "Portasheed."

01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:42.917
- Right. Yeah, that's funny.
- Yeah.

01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:47.591
<i>It was obvious to me that Wichita
and I were meant to be together,</i>

01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:50.673
<i>which is why Madison's return
could not have been worse timing.</i>

01:09:50.800 --> 01:09:55.955
<i>Of course, I was glad she wasn't a zombie.
But couldn't she have just gone back to her mall fridge?</i>

01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:01.080
Hey. Hey, look, look, look.
Look.

01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:05.760
Look.

01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:11.591
We made it to Baby-lon.

01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:17.397
<i>If you hear more than the usual excitement
in my voice, it's for two reasons.</i>

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:21.315
<i>One, we may have caught up
to Little Rock, for real this time.</i>

01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:27.277
<i>And two, we may have finally found our forever home,
which is what I've been looking for all along.</i>

01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:31.196
- Babylon.
- I love that song.

01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:33.680
This place is soy cute.

01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:41.951
- Jesus!
- What the fuck?

01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:45.158
- Enjoy the little things.
- My bags were in there!

01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:47.914
- No, they weren't.
- No guns allowed!

01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:52.595
I like this place already.
You got a sense of humour.

01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:54.273
No guns allowed.

01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:58.917
I'm not giving up my guns
under any circumstances, period-o.

01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.834
Well, then, there's no way
you're getting up to Babylon.

01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:04.037
You know, you could always wait
in the car.

01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:09.552
Do you wanna see
Little Rock or not?

01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:27.790
- There she is.
- I wouldn't know. I'm on a 40-day bowel blast.

01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:28.880
Little Rock.

01:11:30.160 --> 01:11:32.356
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:11:33.280 --> 01:11:35.736
- What are you guys doing here?
- I am so glad you're safe.

01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:37.956
- Wow, okay.
- Oh, my God.

01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:39.040
- Come here.
- Hi.

01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:42.955
- No, seriously, what are you guys doing here?
- Hey, we don't leave each other.

01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:44.599
I know, I know.
I'm really sorry.

01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:47.320
- Make me a pact. No more notes. Ever.
- No more notes. Ever.

01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:48.675
- Ever. Great.
- Okay.

01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:50.717
Just so you guys know,
there's no group sex.

01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:53.997
- Okay, fine, group sex.
- No!

01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:58.512
Hey, Wichita. That means you're Columbus,
and that makes you Tallahassee.

01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:00.512
- Berkeley?
- You're from Berkeley?

01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:02.557
- You're Berkeley?
- No, come on.

01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:04.597
What are the chances we're
both from Berkeley?

01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:06.576
- Berkeley!
- Calm down, calm down. Okay?

01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:11.675
Thank you guys for coming to check up on me, I guess.
But you have to understand these people are peaceful,

01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:16.118
and they're friendly and nice. And honestly,
I don't think you're gonna fit in here.

01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:19.557
- They melted our fucking weapons!
- This is exactly what I meant.

01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:22.155
Guys, I think we should stay.

01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:24.914
- You don't get a vote.
- I do get a vote.

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.037
Haven't you ever heard of women suffering?

01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:28.440
Women suffrage?

01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:31.272
- No, honey.
- Oh, boy.

01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:32.953
- Who the hell is this?
- I'm Madison.

01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:34.554
- Don't say it.
- You'll love this.

01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:37.280
- Don't say it.
- That's Columbus' girlfriend.

01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:38.656
- It's official.
- Wow.

01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:41.320
You reallyjust didn't waste
any time, did you?

01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:44.040
- Well, thank you for your vote.
- And you're welcome.

01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:48.433
- Okay. I'm late for my drum circle, so I gotta go.
- Hey, Little Rock!

01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:50.239
Sorry about that.

01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:03.950
<i>Seeing Little Rock safe
and surrounded by friends her own age,</i>

01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:06.271
<i>Tallahassee realised
his nest was now empty.</i>

01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:10.438
<i>And he began to hear
the call of the buffalo.</i>

01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:17.720
All right, I'm ready!

01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:22.560
Come on, don't be so Gloria Glum.
I told you guys I was leaving.

01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:24.632
So, what,
you're just gonna split?

01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:30.835
It's time. Gotta set out
on my own adventures.

01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:32.752
Little Rock's safe,

01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:35.878
and a lone wolf's gotta hunt.

01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:38.434
So where are you gonna go?

01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:41.513
The direction's
the destination. West.

01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:45.554
West is that way.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:50.516
Yeah. Anyway, like the title of
a great Phil Collins song,

01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:54.389
"If You Love Somebody,
Set Them Free."

01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:56.551
- Pretty sure that wasn't him.
- Pretty sure it was.

01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:58.996
- No, it was someone else.
- Pretty sure it was him.

01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:02.593
Yeah. Peace.

01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:07.235
I'm not much for goodbyes,
so...

01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:10.996
- Yeah, just don't say the pig thing.
- Keep your tits dry.

01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:13.390
- Oh, okay.
- Didn't see that coming, right?

01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:14.880
I would've rather the pig thing.

01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:21.360
Hey.

01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:25.075
Hey, don't do nothing
I wouldn't not do.

01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:28.757
- You get what I'm saying.
- Not really, no.

01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:30.433
No? Okay.

01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:34.519
Anyway, gonna miss you guys.

01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:45.554
- I will never forget you, what's-his-name.
- See you, pals.

01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:48.678
- It's Tallahassee. I told you that.
- Sally Tally!

There it is.
Let's start again.

01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:57.754
Oh, it's all right.
I got it. Excuse me.

01:15:57.840 --> 01:15:58.910
Yes. I got it.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.071
- You're supposed to kick it back.
- Really?

01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:03.795
- You never seen hacky sack?
- Oh, I thought it's like hopscotch.

01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:08.395
- Salty Taffy's back!
- Holy shit!

01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:11.917
Hey, T-800s, a whole swarm of them,
heading right this way.

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:16.199
Those goddamn fireworks
might as well be a dinner bell!

01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:20.752
Stop the fireworks! Stop the music!
Everybody shut the fuck up!

01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:21.876
Shut up.

01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:23.519
Question:

01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:26.155
Did you melt all the weapons?

01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:28.630
Yeah, that's how we made these
cool peace thingies.

01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:30.552
- Oh, Jesus.
- My guns!

01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:34.520
Hey. Hello. I got something going.
I think I might have a plan.

01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:36.675
What?

01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:39.592
I got nothing.
I'm just a songwriter.

01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:41.478
No. No, you're
a song transcriber.

01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:43.313
- Listen, Berkeley?
- Yeah?

01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:45.153
I don't think
this is gonna work out.

01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:48.995
Even 12-year-olds know
who Bob Dylan is, you fucking poser.

01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:53.199
Oh, my God. I'm not gonna lie,
I have truly enjoyed this moment,

01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:54.760
but there are
zombies approaching.

01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:58.920
Okay. Civil War general,
you must know how to fight?

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:00.195
Sure.

01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:02.840
Poverty, sexism,
social injustice.

01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:06.236
- We could try running.
- I'm done running.

01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:09.392
I mean, what good is a home
if you can't stay in it?

01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:10.954
- Columbus.
- Yes, Thor?

01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:13.714
You're making me cry right now.

01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:15.200
- No, please don't.
- Oh, my God.

01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:17.158
Okay.
I moved through it.

01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:19.709
Now from where I stand,
there's only one thing we can do.

01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:21.598
Group sex. Right?

01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:23.920
No.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:27.275
We'll fight them.

01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:31.398
You'll be the first to die,
but I like your enthusiasm.

01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:34.154
- You might die.
- Thank you for your sacrifice.

01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:39.551
All right,
everybody, listen up.

01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:43.475
They outnumber us 100 times,
but they ain't got what we do.

01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:44.480
Guns?

01:17:44.481 --> 01:17:45.755
- We don't have guns.
- What?

01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:50.198
What we do have is heart,
brains and biodiesel.

01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:53.990
<i>We're gonna light these zombies up
like it's the Fourth of July.</i>

01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:58.233
Then we hit the stragglers.
What we do is we form a gauntlet.

01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:02.031
Ha!
One, two, three.

01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:04.555
- Then we mop them up.
- Sick.

01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:07.474
- This is gonna work, right?
- It has to.

01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:19.074
Rolling.

01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:26.555
- Keep screwing.
- Yeah, I am.

01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:27.680
- Keep screwing.
- I am.

01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:44.280
No turning back now.

01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:46.996
There we go.

01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:48.080
Nice.

01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:53.352
Yeah.
Oh, that's gonna work.

01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:57.280
Oh, that's pretty.

01:18:57.281 --> 01:19:00.433
- That means the zombies are coming!
- Okay, you guys, they're coming!

01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:03.479
- Time to nut up or shut up.
- You need a new line.

01:19:04.960 --> 01:19:06.792
Let's kick some dicks.

01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:09.554
Just because it rhymes
doesn't make it a great catchphase.

01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:12.195
- What's her problem?
- I don't know. I like it when it rhymes.

01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:16.797
- Here we go.
- Okay.

01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:34.710
The zombies are coming!

01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:36.216
- Oh, dear.
- Look out, guys!

01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:39.074
- Here they come. They're coming!
- Battle stations!

01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:43.600
Light them up!

01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:02.680
Let's go, let's go!
Get up to safety.

01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:19.115
Here we go.

01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:32.560
Okay now, blow!

01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:38.116
Come on. Now would be
an ideal time to blow.

01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:40.760
- It's not working.
- Damn.

01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:47.600
God.

01:20:47.601 --> 01:20:49.035
Holy shit.
It worked.

01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:50.120
Oh, my God.

01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:55.271
- Okay. Here, now we mop up the stragglers.
- Okay. Yeah.

01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:01.872
Oh, shit. Would those be
considered the stragglers?

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.912
Oh, boy.
Here they come.

01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:06.160
Get ready.

01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:19.719
Kill those motherfuckers!

01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:36.271
Well, guys,
I hate to say this.

01:21:37.480 --> 01:21:39.915
I think this might be
the end of the road.

01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:44.160
- Come here.
- I love you guys.

01:21:44.240 --> 01:21:46.320
- I love you more.
- We had a hell of a run.

01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:50.514
Oh, my God.
They're gonna die.

01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:07.870
Hey!

01:22:14.720 --> 01:22:17.155
Sunday, Sunday, Sunday!

01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:19.232
Thank God for rednecks!

01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:29.273
- Need a ride?
- Oh, yeah.

01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:30.360
- Get in.
- Let's go!

01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:37.400
- Are y'all strapped in yet?
- Yep. Strapping in now.

01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:39.350
Rule four.
Got it.

01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:41.830
- You too.
- I'm not a pussy like Columbus.

01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:42.956
Nothing personal.

01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:46.596
- Oh, God!
- Seatbelts are there for a reason.

01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:47.909
Yep.

01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:53.073
I think I'm feeling
a little nauseous.

01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:55.516
- Can somebody crack a window maybe?
- Oh, no, you don't.

01:22:57.480 --> 01:22:59.039
Little Rock,
roll down the window.

01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:00.560
If you get sick,
we all get sick.

01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:06.519
Okay, okay.
Oh, God.

01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:10.111
Could you just pull over so I can get
eaten by zombies? It'll be more comfortable.

01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:14.869
Whoo!

01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:17.274
- Oh, shit. Watch out!
- Do it!

01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:28.471
Yee-ha!
- Oh, my God, you are sexy.

01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:30.631
Can you not say "sexy"?
I'm already nauseous.

01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:37.360
Shit.
Shit, shit, shit.

01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:40.512
Shit.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:41.640
Shit.

01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:43.160
- Oh, shit.
- You guys okay?

01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:46.392
- Thank you for flying Big Fat Death.
- Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:48.551
I told you these things
were a huge rollover risk.

01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:50.233

- Come on!

01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:53.119

They're coming!

01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:55.136

01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:56.799

- Shit.

01:23:57.840 --> 01:23:59.115

01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:00.200

- Yes!
- Here they come!

01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:22.552
- Go, get in. Go, go, go!
- Go, go, go!

01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:27.396
Run!

01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:33.472
- I'm out of bullets!
- Guys, go! I'm right behind you!

01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:39.632
Get in position! Form the gauntlet!
I'll hold them off!

01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:45.152

01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:22.958
We can't help you.

Guys! Help me!

01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:26.950
- Shit. What should we do?
- Throw something at them.

01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:29.714
Oh, shit. Okay.
Shit. Sorry.

01:26:30.801 --> 01:26:32.837
You hit me in the nuts
with a hacky sack.

01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:33.840
- Sorry.
- What?

01:26:33.841 --> 01:26:36.515
I'm losing my grip.

Guys, I'm still here!

01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:03.032
- Give me your hand!
- Hold my arm.

01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:05.840
- Kick your foot out.
- Goddamn it, Columbus!

01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:08.721
- Point your toe!
- Human chain, this is a terrible idea!

01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:12.160
- I can't reach.
- Kick it, kick it. I got it.

01:27:12.240 --> 01:27:13.310
Pull, pull.

01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:15.160
Okay. I got you.

01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:17.075
Okay.

01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:19.277
Oh, man.
Are you okay?

01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:21.158
- Yeah.
- That was amazing.

01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:23.276
Thank you.

01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:25.550
Hey.

01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:29.800
You kept the gun?

01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:32.111
How could I give up my favourite
Christmas present?

01:27:32.200 --> 01:27:33.953
Why didn't you
pull it out sooner?

01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:37.033
I forget about it but...
I smoked a lot of weed.

01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:40.194
Chip off the old block.

01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:44.440
Yes.

01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:46.160
Yes?

01:27:46.161 --> 01:27:47.719
Oh, yes, yes?

01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:49.796
Yes, yes.

01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:52.390
Yes, yes, yes?

01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:54.278
- Yes. Yes.
- Yes?

01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:55.635
- Really?
- Mm.

01:27:57.840 --> 01:27:59.559
What changed your mind?

01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:02.439
Because Zombieland or not,
we're meant to be together.

01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:10.670
So basically, that means
this belongs to her.

01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:11.760
Oh. Huh.

01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:13.000
Cool.

01:28:13.720 --> 01:28:15.234
Thank you.

01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:16.320
Okay.

01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:21.117
- Okay. Are you ready?
- Yeah.

01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:22.270
- Okay. I'm good.
- Okay.

01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:24.869
- Yeah, do the damn thing. Yeah.
- Okay.

01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:25.920
Great.

01:28:25.921 --> 01:28:28.037
- Which hand do I...?
- This one.

01:28:28.120 --> 01:28:29.554
- Okay.
- Okay, yes. Here we go.

01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:35.196

you didn't die, then.

- Washoe County, Nevada.

01:28:58.840 --> 01:28:59.800
Reno.

01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:07.234
How about home?

01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:08.240
Home?

01:30:08.241 --> 01:30:09.641
- Yeah.
- Yes, good idea.

01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:12.560
Where's home?

01:30:14.240 --> 01:30:15.913

01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:29.276

Please keep your questions focused
on the film and don't go off-topic.

01:31:35.480 --> 01:31:40.714
The idea of a trilogy was something...
As an artist, you think the great ones:

01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:42.200
<i>Godfather</i> and...

01:31:43.960 --> 01:31:44.880
<i>Lethal Weapon.</i>

01:31:44.881 --> 01:31:48.635
But the question is,
why in the world <i>Garfield 3?</i>

01:31:48.720 --> 01:31:50.916
- Can this be just between us?
- Yes.

01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:52.957
Drugs cost money.

01:31:53.040 --> 01:31:57.637
And I have to say, as an actor, how many
of your nine lives do you think you have left?

01:31:57.720 --> 01:32:00.189
Well, I've done three of these.
Three <i>Garfields.</i>

01:32:01.080 --> 01:32:02.230
So that's six.

01:32:02.320 --> 01:32:04.198

01:32:04.280 --> 01:32:05.280
Right.

01:32:05.360 --> 01:32:07.477
...is the hairball.

01:32:07.560 --> 01:32:09.950
Didn't I say? I had a feeling
this would come up.

01:32:10.040 --> 01:32:12.032
Can you give me a hairball?

01:32:14.520 --> 01:32:16.637
Don't wanna do the hairball,
get it out of the way?

01:32:16.760 --> 01:32:18.399
- No.
- Can you try now?

01:32:18.480 --> 01:32:20.995
- Give me a little hairball now?
- Come on.

01:32:23.880 --> 01:32:24.996
Come on.

01:32:30.880 --> 01:32:32.917
You know, how about
if I did it with you?

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:34.912
- Okay. Come on. Come on.
- That was close.

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:36.514

Huge fan, Mr. Roker.

01:33:01.240 --> 01:33:05.280
All right, Tim, let's get out of here.
Somebody get my car. I'm ready to go.

01:33:05.360 --> 01:33:07.829
- I've never seen Al Roker behave that way.
- That was crazy.
