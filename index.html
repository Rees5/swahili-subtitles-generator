He said that Roman couldn't

And he said that
he overheard

<i>And with it, the only key
to the Bertinelli fortune.</i>

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:00.566
Which is exactly
why Roman Sionis

00:20:00.632 --> 00:20:03.202
is trying to
get his hands on it.

00:20:03.269 --> 00:20:05.305
That's what makes him
so dangerous.

00:20:05.372 --> 00:20:07.106
He's already
building an army.

00:20:07.173 --> 00:20:08.208
If he gets the diamond,

00:20:08.273 --> 00:20:09.843
he'll have all the money
and connections

00:20:09.909 --> 00:20:12.045
to bribe every single
judge and cop

00:20:12.112 --> 00:20:14.180

00:57:11.197 --> 00:57:14.233
Become a psychiatrist,
work in an asylum.

00:57:14.300 --> 00:57:15.733
Fall in love
with your patient,

00:57:15.802 --> 00:57:17.735
break said patient
out of said asylum.

00:57:17.804 --> 00:57:19.472
Begin a life of crime.

00:57:19.539 --> 00:57:21.206
Jump into a vat of chemicals
to prove yourself to a madman.

00:57:21.273 --> 00:57:23.141
Get arrested
by the Batman.

00:57:23.208 --> 00:57:24.876
Go back to jail,
get out of jail with a bomb on your neck.

00:57:24.943 --> 00:57:26.579
Save the world, go back to
jail, and break out of jail

00:57:26.646 --> 00:57:28.947
before breaking up
with the aforementioned madman

00:57:29.014 --> 00:57:30.916
and going out
on your own.

00:57:33.585 --> 00:57:35.621
Number two...

00:57:35.688 --> 00:57:37.257
Six bucks for tap water

00:57:37.322 --> 00:57:38.925
with a fucking cucumber stick
in it?

00:57:38.992 --> 00:57:40.159
That's crazy.

00:57:41.860 --> 00:57:44.063
I'm not shopping
at this store.

00:57:45.898 --> 00:57:47.766
I'm robbing this store.

00:57:47.833 --> 00:57:50.469
Consider this
your first lesson.

00:57:50.536 --> 00:57:52.804
Paying is for dummies.

00:57:56.376 --> 00:57:57.876
[both laughing]

00:57:58.978 --> 00:58:00.512
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:58:00.579 --> 00:58:02.282
- [people gasping]
- Move it!

00:58:07.619 --> 00:58:09.222
Whoops. Ah...

00:58:11.356 --> 00:58:14.293
This is Doc's Place.
And this is Doc.

00:58:16.963 --> 00:58:18.797
Lotus flower!

00:58:18.864 --> 00:58:21.300
- Hiya, Doc. How are ya?
- Good.

00:58:21.367 --> 00:58:23.436
He's the Taiwanese grandpa
I never had.

00:58:23.503 --> 00:58:25.505
He knows everything
and everyone.

00:58:25.570 --> 00:58:27.273
Nothing happens around here,
let me tell you,

00:58:27.340 --> 00:58:28.907
without Doc
knowing about it.

00:58:28.974 --> 00:58:32.010
And he happens to be
the only person

00:58:32.077 --> 00:58:33.913
who actually cares
about me.

00:58:33.980 --> 00:58:35.648
- I do?
- Yes, you do.

00:58:35.715 --> 00:58:37.215
She's been ordering #32

00:58:37.282 --> 00:58:39.418
with extra chili
for many years.

00:58:39.485 --> 00:58:40.552
Lesson number two,

00:58:40.619 --> 00:58:42.487
you always want
extra chili with #32.

00:58:42.554 --> 00:58:44.423
[whispers] So you don't
have to taste his cooking.

00:58:44.489 --> 00:58:47.427
Lotus flower, you have to get
upstairs before someone sees.

00:58:47.492 --> 00:58:49.795
Everyone's looking for you.
And you.

00:58:49.862 --> 00:58:51.764
[both] We know.

00:58:51.831 --> 00:58:55.268
I'm telling you,
if you want boys to respect you,

00:58:55.335 --> 00:58:57.936
you have to show them
that you're serious.

00:58:58.003 --> 00:59:01.474
Blow something up.
Shoot someone.

00:59:01.541 --> 00:59:03.943
Nothing gets a guy's
attention like violence.

00:59:04.010 --> 00:59:06.112
Shut that door.
Lock it.

00:59:06.179 --> 00:59:08.547
Keep your sticky paws
to yourself, okay?

00:59:19.358 --> 00:59:20.860
This place...

00:59:20.927 --> 00:59:22.894
Well, it ain't much,
but it's better than a prison cell.

00:59:22.961 --> 00:59:24.896
...is so fucking dope.

00:59:25.498 --> 00:59:26.666
[hyena whines]

00:59:26.733 --> 00:59:29.635
Oh, shit.
Is that a hyena in a bathtub?

00:59:29.702 --> 00:59:32.972
I named him Bruce after
that hunky Wayne guy.

00:59:33.039 --> 00:59:35.775
He's my little dumpling,
aren't you?

00:59:35.842 --> 00:59:37.976
Aren't you,
my little baby?

00:59:38.043 --> 00:59:40.045
Aren't you, Brucey?
Yes.

00:59:40.112 --> 00:59:42.014
I love you.

00:59:43.516 --> 00:59:46.952
I never said that.
I love you both equally.

00:59:47.018 --> 00:59:51.289
- [growling]
- Who, that? It's Cass.

00:59:53.893 --> 00:59:55.260
You're so pretty.

00:59:57.096 --> 00:59:59.498
Who's this?

00:59:59.565 --> 01:00:01.534
It's a beaver.

01:00:01.601 --> 01:00:02.601
Hmm.

01:00:05.103 --> 01:00:09.375
Does Brucey want a treat?
Does Brucey want a treat?

01:00:11.277 --> 01:00:12.478
[Cassandra] What's this?

01:00:16.382 --> 01:00:18.518
It's art.
Don't touch.

01:00:21.420 --> 01:00:23.824
[Cassandra] He your
ex or something?

01:00:23.891 --> 01:00:25.557
You don't know
who that is?

01:00:26.958 --> 01:00:28.161
The Joker.

01:00:28.226 --> 01:00:30.996
The Clown Prince of Crime?

01:00:31.063 --> 01:00:32.664
My former partner
in madness?

01:00:32.731 --> 01:00:35.201
The Harlequin of Hate?
The Jester of Genocide?

01:00:35.268 --> 01:00:37.235
You've never heard of him?

01:00:37.302 --> 01:00:39.539
Well, sounds like a dick.

01:00:42.675 --> 01:00:43.675
Huh.

01:00:49.114 --> 01:00:50.449
[music playing on TV]

01:00:53.753 --> 01:00:55.121

[Harley] <i>I'm not going soft or
nothing, but I gotta admit,</i>

01:01:09.302 --> 01:01:11.704

having the kid around.</i>

01:01:11.771 --> 01:01:12.972
[both laughing]

01:01:13.039 --> 01:01:14.239
[Bruce laughs]

01:01:22.481 --> 01:01:25.451
Give me a #32.
Mild.

01:01:25.518 --> 01:01:27.487
Uh... Yeah, sure.

01:01:31.023 --> 01:01:32.257
[both speaking Mandarin]

01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:49.976
[in English] Who are you?

01:01:50.041 --> 01:01:51.443
They call me...

01:01:53.679 --> 01:01:54.981
H...

01:01:55.047 --> 01:01:56.715
[Harley] <i>My bad.
I should've introduced you.</i>

01:01:56.782 --> 01:01:58.251
<i>I'll make it quick.</i>

<i>Helena Bertinelli.</i>

01:02:10.228 --> 01:02:12.731
<i>Yep, that Bertinelli.</i>

<i>One day,
she comes home to find</i>

Bertinelli blood is there.</i>

01:02:27.679 --> 01:02:31.018

Do you know who I am?

- [soft music playing]
- [indistinct chattering]

01:04:29.367 --> 01:04:30.903
Great club.

01:04:30.971 --> 01:04:32.538
Quinn got the girl.

She is.

No, she's not.
She's...

01:04:57.164 --> 01:04:59.498
What are you laughing at,
Erika?

01:04:59.565 --> 01:05:01.467
Roman, you gotta

01:05:01.534 --> 01:05:04.202
- It's hilarious.
- Get on the table.

- Oh.
- [man] Ooh.

01:05:05.570 --> 01:05:07.739
You're being a total kook.

[continues whimpering]

01:06:30.923 --> 01:06:33.626
You wouldn't betray me,
would you?

01:06:35.829 --> 01:06:37.931
[stammering] I was just
gonna go look for the girl.

01:06:37.998 --> 01:06:40.266
Oh, no, no, no.
I want you to stay here with me.

01:06:40.331 --> 01:06:43.536
I want you to stay here
with me close.

You soothe me,

01:07:00.552 --> 01:07:01.753
Oh, good.
You got it.

01:07:01.822 --> 01:07:03.355
Did you trace the messages?

01:07:03.422 --> 01:07:05.657
You stole evidence
from an active crime scene,

01:07:05.724 --> 01:07:07.092
and then had it
sent to my office.

01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:09.996
Renee, what were
you thinking?

01:07:10.063 --> 01:07:13.099
Roman is the one that put
a price on the kid's head.

01:07:13.166 --> 01:07:14.867
Okay? I had to.

01:07:14.934 --> 01:07:16.302
I can't get into it
right now...

01:07:16.367 --> 01:07:18.070
Renee, you need help.

01:07:18.137 --> 01:07:20.172
What are you talking about?

01:07:20.239 --> 01:07:22.474
[Erickson] She's right.

01:07:22.541 --> 01:07:26.079
You are a good cop, Montoya,
but you've lost your way.

01:07:27.313 --> 01:07:28.713
What?

01:07:28.780 --> 01:07:30.416
[Yee] I'm sorry.
Okay?

01:07:30.481 --> 01:07:32.318
You gave me no choice.

01:07:32.384 --> 01:07:34.385
- Did you sell me out?
- I'm sorry.

01:07:35.021 --> 01:07:36.521
You're suspended.

01:07:37.523 --> 01:07:39.724
Your badge
and your gun, now.

01:07:43.561 --> 01:07:47.099
[Harley] <i>If you've ever

<i>you know that this is
when shit gets real.</i>

01:07:49.768 --> 01:07:51.704
What's the point
of the badge,

01:07:53.472 --> 01:07:55.608
when it means
fuck all anyway?

01:07:57.610 --> 01:07:59.510
Right, Captain?

01:07:59.577 --> 01:08:01.413
<i>No cop
ever gets anything done</i>

01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:03.681
<i>until after they've

<i>Which would've
had me worried,</i>

01:08:07.552 --> 01:08:10.623
<i>only I had
more pressing concerns.</i>

01:08:10.688 --> 01:08:12.391
And that is why
you should never partake

01:08:12.458 --> 01:08:14.793
in paying

what that means?

That means he's not just
